## 🛒 Project Title: **Frontend E-Commerce Website**

---

## 📄 **Project Description**

The **Frontend E-Commerce Website** is a fully responsive and visually appealing online shopping interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates a professional e-commerce platform focused solely on the **frontend aspect** — showcasing key components of an online store such as **product listings**, **categories**, **shopping cart UI**, and **checkout pages**.

Designed with a user-friendly layout, the website includes intuitive navigation, interactive product cards, and a consistent design across devices. It provides the foundation for building a complete e-commerce system and is ideal for frontend developers demonstrating their UI/UX design skills and understanding of responsive web development.

This project does **not include backend functionalities** like payment processing or order management — but the UI is fully ready to connect with APIs or backend services later on.
